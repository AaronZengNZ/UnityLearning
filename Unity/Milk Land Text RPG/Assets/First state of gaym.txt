You enter Dani's milksmith shop.
He offers you a free weapon from the shelves.

A golden dagger lays on the top of the shelf; it seems very sharp.
Mysterious books covered in runes are stacked in the shelf,
And a black bow is covered by the books.

What do you do?
1. Take the dagger.
2. Question about the books.
3. Grab the bow.
