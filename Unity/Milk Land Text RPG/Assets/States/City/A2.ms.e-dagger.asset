  storyText: 'You exit the milksmith shop, wielding your newfound weapon. You see
    something bright in the distance.


    It seems like a ball of milk... or something.
    Probably shouldn''t touch it.


    What to do next?

    1. Try to consume it.

    2.
    Touch It.

    3. Stay right where you are.'
